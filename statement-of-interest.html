      <h2>Event: Mastercard Information Event</h2>
      <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Financial Services<br>
      <strong>Date:</strong> September 24, 2025</p>

      <p>The session was led by Leah Rothberg, Senior Talent Acquisition Specialist for Campus Recruitment at Mastercard. Leah has three years of experience in talent acquisition, and she is passionate about connecting students with opportunities at Mastercard, specifically at their St. Louis office, which is Mastercard's Technology Hub.</p>

      <p>Leah provided an overview of 2026 internship and full-time opportunities, particularly within engineering, business, and technology tracks at the St. Louis office.</p>

      <h2>At the Mastercard event:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Leah discussed the application timeline, usually starts in the fall, with multiple stages: written application, phone interview, team interview, and final offer. In some cases, candidates may advance directly to the final interview. Importantly, all applications are reviewed by real recruiters rather than automated systems.</li>
        <li>Mastercard office emphasizes sustainability, innovation, and employee well-being. The St. Louis campus has modern office spaces, a gym, and a collaborative environment designed to support the balance of their employees.</li>
        <li>WashU Alumni, working at Mastercard, shared diverse experiences, demonstrating that Mastercard values candidates from a wide range of majors and backgrounds.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For me, the most valuable insight was seeing how technology drives innovation in the financial industry. The sector is constantly evolving, and Mastercard's emphasis on secure, efficient, and sustainable solutions aligns with my interest in applying technology to solve real-world problems.</p>

      <h2>My SMART Goal, specific to the Financial Services industry</h2>

      <p>In order to break into the Financial Services industry, I need to become more well versed in the specific roles available to me for this upcoming summer 2026. I will need to review all internship descriptions for financial hub and identify roles that align with my academic background. I will update my resume for each role.</p>

      <p>However, before applying to these roles I need to develop my technical skillset to be the best version of myself I can. Between January and March 2026, I will complete at least two online courses in data analytics and API integration to strengthen my technical profile.</p>

      <p>The financial services industry is not only about my skillset but also my connections in the industry. I will connect with at least three alumni from WashU on LinkedIn by <strong>March 2026</strong>, connecting with them on past experiences, insightful questions, and creating a relationship for the future.</p>

      <p>Through these steps, my goal is to not only to position myself competitively, but also to build a foundation for a career in the financial services industry in a tech-related role, where technically innovation meets constant business adaptability.</p>
